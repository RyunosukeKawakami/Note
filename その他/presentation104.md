Today I would like to talk you about Leonhard Euler. he was mathematician.
the reason why I select him is that his research influenced all field of mathmatics and he created many field. you can watch his name in all field of mathmatics. Foexample, euler circle, euler problem, euler's fomula, and other are discoverd by euler.
one of his great point is a number of paper. he wrote more than 50 thouthand pages in his life. these are about 63 times ordinary scholar's pages so his research have been publishing now since 18 century.
Another great point is that he created modern physics field. before him, physics theory is made by scholar's experience. But he created many theory by using mathmatics. It means physics is put togher Stricly by him.
